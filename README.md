# Memory-Maps

## Description/User Story

The world has become increasingly globalized, which means people have the
capacity to travel at a far greater frequency than at any point in history.
When we travel, we want to preserve the memories from our journeys, whether
it be organizing our photos or jotting down a few thoughts/reflections from
our experience in a particular country or city. There has long been a tradition
of travel writing in humanity, dating back to the Ancient Greek writer Herodotus;
yet, the digital age needs to combine this long-standing tradition of travel
writing with a quick, easy, on-hand platform.


Memory Maps is a simple app that allows all travellers to record the countries
and cities they've visited. It also allows users to store photos associated with
the country of interest on a country profile page. This country profile page
will also contain short blurbs about a particular site or city the user has
experienced. Ultimately, it allows travellers to preserve the memories from
the places they've been and access them at a later date.
